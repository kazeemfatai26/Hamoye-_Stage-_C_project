# Haamoye Web Scraping Project


## Dataset - Car info from cars.com

> The information scraped from the website includes the model of the car, the mileage, Price of the car, ratings and number of reviews the car has garnered. I also extracted from the model of the car, the Year the car was produced.


## Summary of Findings
> i discovered that the Average price of a car in this data is 44,212 dollars and the average rating given to a BMW car is 4.45 which is quite on the good side.However, there is no direct relationship between number of cars and the sum of prices as 2018 has more cars than 2022 but 2022 has the higher sum of the prices of cars.From the website scraped, it shows that only used cars have mileage covered hence, the maximum miles ,cars produced in the specified years, have gone is not linearly with how far behind the year.No mileage were recorded for year 2023 as there were no used cars in that year yet. 2013 has the cars with the high mileage.My investigation also showed that cars produced in years far behind have an higher average mileage when compred to the most recent years.
